					<h2>Background</h2>
				</header>
				<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
					Currently employed as a Programmer Analyst at the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, where
					I am currently training to developing reporting software for the transportation division. My
					training encompasses a diverse skill set including T-SQL, Azure, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
					Prior to joining the Public Service Commission, I held roles at Chick-fil-A as a cook and at the
					International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as a stagehand. These experiences instilled in
					me time management, communication, and teamwork skills. They also fostered my ability to
					adapt to various environments, follow instructions meticulously, and collaborate effectively to
					achieve shared objectives.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
					I graduated from West Virginia University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a
					Minor in Communication Studies. During my academic journey, I acquired proficiency in Java, C,
					MATLAB, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Agile Development, Assembly, and GitHub.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
					Outside of my professional endeavors, I engage in a range of activities including weightlifting,
					kickboxing, Ju Jitsu, boxing, basketball, golf, and music. Recently, I've also been learning to play the
					piano.

					<p style="text-indent: 5em;" ><span class="image right"><img  style ="border-radius: 5px;" src="images/wvu.jpg" alt="" /></span>My time at West Virginia University not only provided me with a robust education but also
						facilitated the formation of lifelong friendships and cherished memories. I connected with
						individuals from diverse backgrounds through various avenues such as classes, the Sigma Chi
						fraternity, pickup basketball games, and the kickboxing gym. Within the university community, I participated in philanthropic initiatives, through the Mu Mu
						chapter of Sigma Chi. Our endeavors, including events like Derby Days, raised twelve thousand
						dollars for cancer research, supporting the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. These experiences not only
						enriched my collegiate years but also reinforced the significance of giving back to the community.

							clinching the 2017 AAA West Virginia Baseball State Championship and repeating in 2019. These landmark achievements made us the only baseball team in school history to win a state title. High school not only honed my academic and athletic abilities but also sculpted my character, shaping me into the individual I am today.</p>
