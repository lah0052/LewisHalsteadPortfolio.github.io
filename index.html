				<h2>Background</h2>
				<article>
						<p style="text-indent: 5em;">
							Currently employed as a Programmer Analyst at the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, where
							I am currently training to developing reporting software for the transportation division. My
							training encompasses a diverse skill set including T-SQL, Azure, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
						
							Prior to joining the Public Service Commission, I held roles at Chick-fil-A as a cook and at the
							International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as a stagehand. These experiences instilled in
							me time management, communication, and teamwork skills. They also fostered my ability to
							adapt to various environments, follow instructions meticulously, and collaborate effectively to
							achieve shared objectives.
						
						
							I graduated from West Virginia University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and a
							Minor in Communication Studies. During my academic journey, I acquired proficiency in Java, C,
							MATLAB, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Agile Development, Assembly, and GitHub.
						
						
							Outside of my professional endeavors, I engage in a range of activities including weightlifting,
							kickboxing, Ju Jitsu, boxing, basketball, golf, and music. Recently, I've also been learning to play the
							piano.

					<span class="light-italic-txt">Aug 2019 - Dec 2023</span>
					<p style="text-indent: 5em;" >My time at West Virginia University not only provided me with a robust education but also
					facilitated the formation of lifelong friendships and cherished memories. I connected with
					individuals from diverse backgrounds through various avenues such as classes, the Sigma Chi
					fraternity, pickup basketball games, and the kickboxing gym. Within the university community, I participated in philanthropic initiatives, through the Mu Mu
					chapter of Sigma Chi. Our endeavors, including events like Derby Days, raised twelve thousand
					dollars for cancer research, supporting the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. These experiences not only
					enriched my collegiate years but also reinforced the significance of giving back to the community.

High school not only honed my academic and athletic abilities but also sculpted my character, shaping me into the individual I am today.</p>
