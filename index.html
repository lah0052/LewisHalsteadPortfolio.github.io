					<p style="text-indent: 5em;" ><span class="image right"><img  style ="border-radius: 5px;" src="images/wvu.jpg" alt="West Virginias Univeristies downtown campus" /></span>My time at West Virginia University not only provided me with a robust education but also
						facilitated the formation of lifelong friendships and cherished memories. I connected with
						individuals from diverse backgrounds through various avenues such as classes, the Sigma Chi
						fraternity, pickup basketball games, and the kickboxing gym. Within the university community, I participated in philanthropic initiatives, through the Mu Mu
						chapter of Sigma Chi. Our endeavors, including events like Derby Days, raised twelve thousand
						dollars for cancer research, supporting the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. These experiences not only
						enriched my collegiate years but also reinforced the significance of giving back to the community.
